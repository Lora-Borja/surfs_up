## Analysis Overview
Surf n' Shake Shop is the plan to turn a newfound passion of surfing into a business opportunity. The idea is to serve surf boards and ice cream to locals and tourists in the beautiful island of Oahu, Hawaii. In order to make this plan a reality, an initial analysis was performed on a weather database provided by a potential investor, W. Avy, to specifically answer his only concern before committing to invest -- what about the Oahu weather? He previously invested in a surf shop on the same island but went out of business and he felt that it was because he did not request a weather analysis.

The initial results analyzed the precipitation levels within the previous 12 months of data, starting from August 23, 2017, which was plotted in a graph. In addition to the plot, a statistical analysis was also provided that summarized the average, the minimum, the maximum, and the total amount of precipitation throughout the year. The other information provided are:
* The total number of stations from which precipitation data was collected from and which stations tend to have the most precipitation recordings
* The minimum, maximum, and average temperature based on the most active station

After presenting the initial results via a web link, W. Avy requested temperature data specifically for the months of June and December, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. The additional analysis resulted into two statistical summaries which was presented for each month's data.    

## Analysis Results
* The initial temperature observations based on the most active station divided into 12 different bins

This graph shows that within the previous 12 months of data a vast majority of the observations were over 67°F -- an ideal weather for surfing and ice cream! Looking at the bins to the right of the 67 degrees, we can say that roughly 325 days was where the temperature was observed at its highest. 


* The Summary Statistics for June

* The Summary Statistics for December

The above statistics shows these key differences in weather between June and December:
* The highest temperature is only slightly higher in June than in December - 85°F and 83°F respectively!
* The lowest temperature also shows a slight variance between June and December - 64°F versus 56°F!
* Majority of the data in both months are above the ideal temperature of 67°F!
* The average temperatures in both months are still warm enough for surfing and ice cream!

## Summary
Overall, the initial analysis results along with the specific information provided for the months of June and December determines that the Surf n' Shake Shop is a well-grounded business plan that is sustainable all year-round. The island of Oahu, Hawaii is a place with great weather -- mostly sunny and warm! The precipitation data shows that there are much more sunny days than rainy days within a given year. Even on what is considered the wet month of December, we can say that the temperatures throughout the month are still warm enough for surfing and ice cream, with majority of the data above the ideal temperature of 67°F.
